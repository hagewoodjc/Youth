<h2>2 Corinthians 8</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia; <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, <i>they gave</i> of their own accord, <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>and <i>this</i>, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also. <p><sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>But as ye abound in everything, <i>in</i> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <i>in</i> all earnestness, and <i>in</i> your love to us, <i>see</i> that ye abound in this grace also. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And herein I give <i>my</i> judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>But now complete the doing also; that as <i>there was</i> the readiness to will, so <i>there may be</i> the completion also out of your ability. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>For if the readiness is there, <i>it is</i> acceptable according as <i>a man</i> hath, not according as <i>he</i> hath not. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For <i>I say</i> not <i>this</i> that others may be eased <i>and</i> ye distressed; <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>but by equality: your abundance <i>being a supply</i> at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become <i>a supply</i> for your want; that there may be equality: <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>as it is written, He that <i>gathered</i> much had nothing over; and he that <i>gathered</i> little had no lack. <p><sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel <i>is spread</i> through all the churches; <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in <i>the matter of</i> this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and <i>to show</i> our readiness: <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in <i>the matter of</i> this bounty which is ministered by us: <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which <i>he hath</i> in you. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>Whether <i>any inquire</i> about Titus, <i>he is</i> my partner and <i>my</i> fellow-worker to you-ward, or our brethren, <i>they are</i> the messengers of the churches, <i>they are</i> the glory of Christ. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_7.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
