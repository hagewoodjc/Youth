<h2>1 Corinthians 13</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And if I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And if I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor</i>, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing. <p><sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Love suffereth long, <i>and</i> is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. <p><sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Love never faileth: but whether <i>there be</i> prophecies, they shall be done away; whether <i>there be</i> tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there be</i> knowledge, it shall be done away. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_12.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
