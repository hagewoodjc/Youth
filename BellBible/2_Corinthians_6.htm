<h2>2 Corinthians 6</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And working together <i>with him</i> we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succor thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation): <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed; <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>in pureness, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and <i>yet</i> true; <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>as unknown, and <i>yet</i> well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <i>yet</i> possessing all things. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto <i>my</i> children), be ye also enlarged. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness? <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever? <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you, <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_5.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
