<h2>1 Chronicles 14</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. <p><sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations. <hr><a HREF="1_Chronicles_13.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
