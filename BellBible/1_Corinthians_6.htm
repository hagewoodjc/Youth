<h2>1 Corinthians 6</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life? <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church? <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>I say <i>this</i> to move you to shame. What, cannot there be <i>found</i> among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren, <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that <i>your</i> brethren. <p><sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_5.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
