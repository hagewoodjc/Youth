<h2>1 Corinthians 16</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem: <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia; <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost; <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. <p><sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do: <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all <i>his</i> will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity. <p><sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Let all that ye do be done in love. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints), <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such. <p><sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_15.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
