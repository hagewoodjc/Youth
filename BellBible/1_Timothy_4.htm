<h2>1 Timothy 4</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>forbidding to marry, <i>and commanding</i> to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed <i>until now</i>: <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>but refuse profane and old wives' fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>These things command and teach. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee. <hr><a HREF="1_Timothy_3.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
