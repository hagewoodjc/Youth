<h2>1 Chronicles 17</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah <i>dwelleth</i> under curtains. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar? <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>and <i>as</i> from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. <p><sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>What can David <i>say</i> yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>O Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all <i>these</i> great things. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt? <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found <i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant: <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever. <hr><a HREF="1_Chronicles_16.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
