<h2>1 Corinthians 12</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts</i>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Ye know that when ye were Gentiles <i>ye were</i> led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another <i>divers</i> kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>For the body is not one member, but many. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>And if they were all one member, where were the body? <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>But now they are many members, but one body. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>and those <i>parts</i> of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely <i>parts</i> have more abundant comeliness; <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>whereas our comely <i>parts</i> have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that <i>part</i> which lacked; <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>that there should be no schism in the body; but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care one for another. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or <i>one</i> member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. <p><sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, <i>divers</i> kinds of tongues. <sup><a NAME="29">29</a></sup>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all <i>workers of</i> miracles? <sup><a NAME="30">30</a></sup>have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? <sup><a NAME="31">31</a></sup>But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_11.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
