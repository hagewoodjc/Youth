<h2>1 Corinthians 11</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>for this cause ought the woman to have <i>a sign of</i> authority on her head, because of the angels. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled? <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. <p><sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper: <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>for in your eating each one taketh before <i>other</i> his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. <p><sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink <i>it</i>, in remembrance of me. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come. <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. <sup><a NAME="29">29</a></sup>For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. <sup><a NAME="30">30</a></sup>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. <sup><a NAME="31">31</a></sup>But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. <sup><a NAME="32">32</a></sup>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. <sup><a NAME="33">33</a></sup>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another. <sup><a NAME="34">34</a></sup>If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_10.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
