<h2>2 Chronicles 13</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of <i>other</i> lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of <i>them that are</i> no gods. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and <i>we have</i> priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work: <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also <i>set they</i> in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper. <p><sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo. <hr><a HREF="2_Chronicles_12.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
