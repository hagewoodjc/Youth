<h2>2 Corinthians 12</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth), <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in <i>my</i> weaknesses. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me <i>to be</i>, or heareth from me. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for <i>my</i> power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except <i>it be</i> that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <i>walked we</i> not in the same steps? <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, <i>are</i> for your edifying. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means <i>there should be</i> strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_11.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
