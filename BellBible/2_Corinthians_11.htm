<h2>2 Corinthians 11</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you <i>as</i> a pure virgin to Christ. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or <i>if</i> ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with <i>him</i>. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>But though <i>I be</i> rude in speech, yet <i>am I</i> not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made <i>this</i> manifest unto you in all things. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought? <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>I robbed other churches, taking wages <i>of them</i> that I might minister unto you; <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <i>so</i> will I keep <i>myself</i>. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works. <p><sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if <i>ye do</i>, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise <i>yourselves</i>. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you <i>captive</i>, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also. <p><sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Of the Jews five times received I forty <i>stripes</i> save one. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep; <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>in</i> journeyings often, <i>in</i> perils of rivers, <i>in</i> perils of robbers, <i>in</i> perils from <i>my</i> countrymen, <i>in</i> perils from the Gentiles, <i>in</i> perils in the city, <i>in</i> perils in the wilderness, <i>in</i> perils in the sea, <i>in</i> perils among false brethren; <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>in</i> labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches. <sup><a NAME="29">29</a></sup>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not? <sup><a NAME="30">30</a></sup>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness. <sup><a NAME="31">31</a></sup>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not. <sup><a NAME="32">32</a></sup>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me: <sup><a NAME="33">33</a></sup>and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_10.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
