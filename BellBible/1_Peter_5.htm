<h2>1 Peter 5</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to <i>the will of</i> God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you. <p><sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour, <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. <p><sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>To him <i>be</i> the dominion for ever and ever. Amen. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account <i>him</i>, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand ye fast therein. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>She that is in Babylon, elect together with <i>you</i>, saluteth you; and <i>so doth</i> Mark my son. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ. <hr><a HREF="1_Peter_4.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
