<h2>1 Corinthians 9</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. <p><sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>My defence to them that examine me is this. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Have we no right to eat and to drink? <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working? <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same? <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth, <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, <i>to thresh</i> in hope of partaking. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things? <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>If others partake of <i>this</i> right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat <i>of</i> the things of the temple, <i>and</i> they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. <p><sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for <i>it were</i> good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. <p><sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>For though I was free from all <i>men,</i> I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>And I do all things for the gospel's sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof. <p><sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they <i>do it</i> to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_8.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
