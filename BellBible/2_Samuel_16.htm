<h2>2 Samuel 16</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And when David was a little past the top <i>of the ascent</i>, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art <i>taken</i> in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so? <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more <i>may</i> this Benjamite now <i>do it</i>? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for <i>his</i> cursing of me this day. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. <p><sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, <i>Long</i> live the king, <i>Long</i> live the king. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>And again, whom should I serve? <i>should I</i> not <i>serve</i> in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. <hr><a HREF="2_Samuel_15.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
