<h2>1 Corinthians 5</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one <i>of you</i> hath his father's wife. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing, <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? <p><sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, <i>even</i> Christ: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <p><sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>not at all <i>meaning</i> with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_4.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
