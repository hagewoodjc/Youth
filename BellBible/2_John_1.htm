<h2>2 John 1</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth; <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever: <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>I rejoice greatly that I have found <i>certain</i> of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it. <p><sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, <i>even</i> they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son. <p><sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into <i>your</i> house, and give him no greeting: <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Having many things to write unto you, I would not <i>write them</i> with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>The children of thine elect sister salute thee. <hr><a HREF="1_John_5.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
