<h2>2 Chronicles 14</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God: <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor. <p><sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. <hr><a HREF="2_Chronicles_13.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
