<h2>2 Corinthians 3</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you? <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables <i>that are</i> hearts of flesh. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>But if the ministration of death, written, <i>and</i> engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which <i>glory</i> was passing away: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory? <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>For if that which passeth away <i>was</i> with glory, much more that which remaineth <i>is</i> in glory. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech, <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>and <i>are</i> not as Moses, <i>who</i> put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away: <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed <i>to them</i> that it is done away in Christ. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, <i>there</i> is liberty. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_2.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
