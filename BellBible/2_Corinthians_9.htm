<h2>2 Corinthians 9</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared: <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion. <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>But this <i>I say,</i> He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Let</i> each man <i>do</i> according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God; <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>seeing that through the proving <i>of you</i> by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of <i>your</i> contribution unto them and unto all; <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_8.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
