<h2>2 Corinthians 5</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven: <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>(for we walk by faith, not by sight); <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things <i>done</i> in the body, according to what he hath done, whether <i>it be</i> good or bad. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but <i>speak</i> as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died; <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again. <p><sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know <i>him so</i> no more. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Wherefore if any man is in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation; <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech <i>you</i> on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>Him who knew no sin he made <i>to be</i> sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_4.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
