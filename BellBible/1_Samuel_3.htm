<h2>1 Samuel 3</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see), <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down <i>to sleep</i>, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was; <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And he said, What is the thing that <i>Jehovah</i> hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good. <p><sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah. <hr><a HREF="1_Samuel_2.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
