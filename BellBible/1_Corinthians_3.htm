<h2>1 Corinthians 3</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able <i>to bear it</i>: nay, not even now are ye able; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men? <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men? <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are God's husbandry, God's building. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>If any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire. <p><sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye. <p><sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness: <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain. <p><sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours; <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_2.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
