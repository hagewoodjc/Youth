<h2>1 Corinthians 10</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>and did all eat the same spiritual food; <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. <p><sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>But <i>I say</i>, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? <p><sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Let no man seek his own, but <i>each</i> his neighbor's <i>good</i>. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake, <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>If one of them that believe not biddeth you <i>to a feast</i>, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: <sup><a NAME="29">29</a></sup>conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? <sup><a NAME="30">30</a></sup>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? <sup><a NAME="31">31</a></sup>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. <sup><a NAME="32">32</a></sup>Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God: <sup><a NAME="33">33</a></sup>even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the <i>profit</i> of the many, that they may be saved. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_9.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
