<h2>1 Timothy 1</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope; <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; <i>so do I now</i>. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned: <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking; <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>I thank him that enabled me, <i>even</i> Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to <i>his</i> service; <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief; <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief: <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, <i>be</i> honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. <p><sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare; <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith: <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme. <hr><a HREF="2_Thessalonians_3.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
