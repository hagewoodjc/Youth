<h2>1 Corinthians 8</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him. <p><sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is <i>anything</i> in the world, and that there is no God but one. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. <p><sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as <i>of</i> a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_7.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
