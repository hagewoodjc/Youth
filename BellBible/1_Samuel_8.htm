<h2>1 Samuel 8</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice. <p><sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah; <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and <i>he will set some</i> to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us, <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. <hr><a HREF="1_Samuel_7.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
