<h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness; <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all. <p><sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Rejoice always; <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>pray without ceasing; <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>Quench not the Spirit; <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>despise not prophesyings; <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>prove all things; hold fast that which is good; <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>abstain from every form of evil. <p><sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>Brethren, pray for us. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. <hr><a HREF="1_Thessalonians_4.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
