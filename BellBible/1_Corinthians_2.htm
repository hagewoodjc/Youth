<h2>1 Corinthians 2</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought: <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, <i>even</i> the <i>wisdom</i> that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory: <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And <i>which</i> entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>But unto us God revealed <i>them</i> through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual <i>words</i>. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_1.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
