<h2>2 Samuel 1</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead? <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed? <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed. <p><sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>(and he bade them teach the children of Judah <i>the song of</i> the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar): <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen! <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women. <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished! <hr><a HREF="1_Samuel_31.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
