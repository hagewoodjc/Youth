<h2>1 Thessalonians 1</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. <p><sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention <i>of you</i> in our prayers; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election, <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and <i>in</i> much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake. <p><sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit; <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God, <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, <i>even</i> Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come. <hr><a HREF="Colossians_4.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
