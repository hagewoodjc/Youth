<h2>1 Timothy 2</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, <i>himself</i> man, Christ Jesus, <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony <i>to be borne</i> in its own times; <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. <p><sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>For Adam was first formed, then Eve; <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety. <hr><a HREF="1_Timothy_1.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
