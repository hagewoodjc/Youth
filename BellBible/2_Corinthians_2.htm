<h2>2 Corinthians 2</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me? <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you. <p><sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was <i>inflicted</i> by the many; <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>Wherefore I beseech you to confirm <i>your</i> love toward him. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>But to whom ye forgive anything, I <i>forgive</i> also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes <i>have I forgiven it</i> in the presence of Christ; <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices. <p><sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord, <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ. <hr><a HREF="2_Corinthians_1.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
