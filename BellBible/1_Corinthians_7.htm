<h2>1 Corinthians 7</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. <p><sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>But unto the married I give charge, <i>yea</i> not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such <i>cases</i>: but God hath called us in peace. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife? <p><sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use <i>it</i> rather. <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God. <p><sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, <i>namely,</i> that it is good for a man to be as he is. <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you. <sup><a NAME="29">29</a></sup>But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; <sup><a NAME="30">30</a></sup>and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; <sup><a NAME="31">31</a></sup>and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away. <sup><a NAME="32">32</a></sup>But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: <sup><a NAME="33">33</a></sup>but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, <sup><a NAME="34">34</a></sup>and is divided. <i>So</i> also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. <sup><a NAME="35">35</a></sup>And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. <p><sup><a NAME="36">36</a></sup>But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin <i>daughter</i>, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry. <sup><a NAME="37">37</a></sup>But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin <i>daughter</i>, shall do well. <sup><a NAME="38">38</a></sup>So then both he that giveth his own virgin <i>daughter</i> in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better. <p><sup><a NAME="39">39</a></sup>A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. <sup><a NAME="40">40</a></sup>But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. <hr><a HREF="1_Corinthians_6.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
