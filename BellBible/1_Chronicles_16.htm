<h2>1 Chronicles 16</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion <i>of flesh</i>, and a cake of raisins. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel: <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God. <p><sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>The covenant</i> which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac, <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant, <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance; <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it; <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm. <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods. <sup><a NAME="26">26</a></sup>For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens. <sup><a NAME="27">27</a></sup>Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place. <sup><a NAME="28">28</a></sup>Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength; <sup><a NAME="29">29</a></sup>Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy array. <sup><a NAME="30">30</a></sup>Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved. <sup><a NAME="31">31</a></sup>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth. <sup><a NAME="32">32</a></sup>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein; <sup><a NAME="33">33</a></sup>Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth. <sup><a NAME="34">34</a></sup>O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness <i>endureth</i> for ever. <sup><a NAME="35">35</a></sup>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise. <sup><a NAME="36">36</a></sup>Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. <p><sup><a NAME="37">37</a></sup>So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required; <sup><a NAME="38">38</a></sup>and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers; <sup><a NAME="39">39</a></sup>and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon, <sup><a NAME="40">40</a></sup>to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel; <sup><a NAME="41">41</a></sup>and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness <i>endureth</i> for ever; <sup><a NAME="42">42</a></sup>and with them Heman and Jeduthun <i>with</i> trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and <i>with</i> instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. <sup><a NAME="43">43</a></sup>And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. <hr><a HREF="1_Chronicles_15.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
