<h2>1 John 4</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the <i>spirit</i> of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already. <p><sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Ye are of God, <i>my</i> little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>They are of the world: therefore speak they <i>as</i> of the world, and the world heareth them. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. <p><sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God. <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. <p><sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Saviour of the world. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. <p><sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>We love, because he first loved us. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also. <hr><a HREF="1_John_3.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
