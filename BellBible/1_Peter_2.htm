<h2>1 Peter 2</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation; <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: <p><sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>But ye are a elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for <i>God's</i> own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. <sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul; <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. <p><sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme; <sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>Servants, <i>be</i> in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully. <sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted <i>for it</i>, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <i>for it</i>, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: <sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered threatened not; but committed <i>himself</i> to him that judgeth righteously: <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. <sup><a NAME="25">25</a></sup>For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. <hr><a HREF="1_Peter_1.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
