<h2>1 John 3</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and <i>such</i> we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And every one that hath this hope <i>set</i> on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. <p><sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him. <sup><a NAME="7">7</a></sup>My</i> little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: <sup><a NAME="8">8</a></sup>he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. <sup><a NAME="9">9</a></sup>Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. <sup><a NAME="10">10</a></sup>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. <p><sup><a NAME="11">11</a></sup>For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: <sup><a NAME="12">12</a></sup>not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous. <sup><a NAME="13">13</a></sup>Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you. <p><sup><a NAME="14">14</a></sup>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death. <sup><a NAME="15">15</a></sup>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. <sup><a NAME="16">16</a></sup>Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. <sup><a NAME="17">17</a></sup>But whoso hath the world's goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? <sup><a NAME="18">18</a></sup>My</i> Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. <sup><a NAME="19">19</a></sup>Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him: <p><sup><a NAME="20">20</a></sup>because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. <sup><a NAME="21">21</a></sup>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; <sup><a NAME="22">22</a></sup>and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. <p><sup><a NAME="23">23</a></sup>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. <sup><a NAME="24">24</a></sup>And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us. <hr><a HREF="1_John_2.htm"><img SRC="back.gif" ALT="Back" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="32"></a>
