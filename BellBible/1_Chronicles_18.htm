<h2>1 Chronicles 18</h2><hr><sup><a NAME="1">1</a></sup>And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. <sup><a NAME="2">2</a></sup>And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. <sup><a NAME="3">3</a></sup>And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. <sup><a NAME="4">4</a></sup>And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. <sup><a NAME="5">5</a></sup>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. <sup><a NAME="6">6</a></sup>Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
